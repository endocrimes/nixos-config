# nixos-config 

This repository stores the system and user configurations for many of my
machines.

System configurations handle configuring the core global services required to
have a basic functional system.

My userland is then configured as part of my [dotfiles][dotfiles] repository and
via [home-manager][home-manager], either as part of the system config, or by
referencing this repository.
